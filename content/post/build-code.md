## openSUSE {#build-code-on-opensuse}
The instructions below have been prepared for and tested on openSUSE Leap 15.3. You might need to do small adjustments for other releases.

### Dependencies
We need LibreOffice core, POCO library and several other libraries and tools to build `CODE`. Open a terminal and follow the steps below.

```bash
# For Leap 15.3
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/libraries:/c_c++/15.3/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo

# For Leap 15.4
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/libraries:/c_c++/15.4/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo
```
If this is fresh instalation it might be worth install devel-basis pattern: Minimal set of tools for compiling and linking applications.
It will bring in things like git, gcc, etc.
```bash
sudo zypper install -t pattern devel_basis
```
Now go ahead and install the following packages
```bash
zypper in poco-devel libcap-progs python3-polib libcap-devel npm libtool cppunit-devel pam-devel python3-lxml chromium

# If you are using Leap 15.4 please install this aditional compatability library
zypper in libpng16-compat-devel
```

<section id="build-code-debian" class="build-code-content">

## Debian {#build-code-on-debian}
The instructions below have been prepared for and tested on Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye). You might need to do small
adjustments for other releases.


*Note: Sometimes Debian comes without sudo preinstalled. If you do not have sudo, you will need to run `apt install -y sudo` as root. It is not good enough to only run the commands which require sudo below as root, as sudo is also run during `make`*

### Dependencies
We need LibreOffice core, POCO library and several other libraries and tools to build `CODE`. Open a terminal and follow the steps below.

Lets start by installing the `dialog` package, which will be needed while installing some
of the other packages:
```bash
sudo apt install -y dialog
```

Now install the rest of the required packages:
```bash
sudo apt install -y libpoco-dev python3-polib libcap-dev npm \
                    libpam-dev wget git build-essential libtool \
                    libcap2-bin python3-lxml libpng-dev libcppunit-dev \
                    pkg-config fontconfig chromium

## Ubuntu {#build-code-on-ubuntu}
The instructions below have been prepared for and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You might need to do small
adjustments for other releases.

### Dependencies
We need LibreOffice core, POCO library and several other libraries and tools to build `CODE`. Open a terminal and follow the steps below.

Lets start by installing the `dialog` package, which will be needed while installing some

                    pkg-config fontconfig snapd chromium-browser
```

*Note: Chomium is needed and used in cpress tests. Ubuntu has no chromium deb packages in its repositories, only a dummy pacakge that points to the respective snap. Probably best to make sure you have snapd installed and install chromium-browser which in turn will install the snap package.*

<section id="build-code-general" class="build-code-content">

## Build CODE & LO {#build-code-n-lo}

### Dependencies

The CODE must be built on Linux, and you need the following:

* LibreOffice
  + you need to build your own tree
* Poco library: http://pocoproject.org/
  + either use a package from your distro, or build it yourself (see below)
* libpng, libcap-progs, libtool, automake, autoconf, pkg-config, sudo, pam
  + use the packages from your distro

You may also want to have the following optional dependencies:

* Chromium
  + Needed for running cypress tests
* The lxml and polib libraries for python
  + Needed for building javascript
  + These can both be installed via pip or your distro's packages
* Cppunit
  + Needed for unit tests
* Node.js
  + Needed for building the JS parts (not needed if you build them on another linux machine)

### LibreOffice

CODE needs LibreOffice to be built to run. However, you have two options to meet this requirement: either by building it locally (Option A - recommended), or by downloading a daily built archive (Option B - quick & dirty) which contains only the absolutely necessary pieces. If you are working only on the online side, without doing any code-level changes on the LibreOffice core, or you just want to quickly get going to do some small fixes, you may prefer the second way.

#### Option A - Build LibreOffice locally (Recommended)
To build LibreOffice, follow the LibreOffice building pages:

https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/BuildingOnLinux

Make sure you use and build the following specific core branch: `distro/collabora/co-22.05`

#### Option B - Download a Daily-Built Archive of LibreOffice (Quick & Dirty)
Download the daily archive:
```
wget https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/releases/download/for-code-assets/core-co-22.05-assets.tar.gz
```

Extract the archive:
```
tar xvf core-co-22.05-assets.tar.gz
```

You should now have two new directories extracted: `instdir` and `include`. You will use the locations of these directories for the `configure` parameters in the following steps.

### POCO

If you use openSUSE Leap 15.3, you can use:

    zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/libraries:/c_c++/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/devel:libraries:c_c++.repo
    zypper in poco-devel libcap-progs python3-polib libcap-devel npm libtool cppunit-devel pam-devel python3-lxml

Similar repos exist for other openSUSE and SLE releases.

Collabora provides Poco packages for Debian 8, Debian 9, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS,
and CentOS 7 via the CODE (Collabora Online Development Edition) repositories,
see:

https://www.collaboraoffice.com/code/linux-packages/

Alternatively you can build your own POCO. In that case, ideally use a recent version like
1.10.1 or newer.

### Building CODE

You need to clone it, run autoconf/automake, configure and build using the GNU
make:
{{% common-build-commands section="clone-online" %}}
```bash
./autogen.sh
```
```bash
./configure --enable-silent-rules --with-lokit-path=${MASTER}/include \
            --with-lo-path=${MASTER}/instdir \
            --with-poco-includes=<POCOINST>/include --with-poco-libs=<POCOINST>/lib \
            --enable-debug --enable-cypress
```
Note: you can also add `--disable-ssl` instead of changing coolwsd.xml everytime you want to disable ssl.
```bash
make -j `nproc`
```
In the above, `${MASTER}` is the location of the LibreOffice source tree you have built
in the previous steps. `POCOINST` is the location of your custom-built or externally installed POCO library.
If you use POCO from a distro package (not a self-built version), you can omit
the `--with-poco-includes` and `--with-poco-libs` from the above.
