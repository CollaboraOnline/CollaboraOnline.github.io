Sorry about that — but you can help us resolving it by creating a great bug
report! See the steps how to do it, and [file the bug on GitHub](https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/issues/new/choose "File the bug on GitHub").

<!--more-->
## File a good bug report

When you find a bug, please make sure you can reproduce it and identify
the necessary steps to trigger it. Then describe the steps on GitHub:

    https://github.com/CollaboraOnline/online/issues/new/choose

## Try to reproduce it
If the bug is specific to a file, please try to create a blank one and add just
the content that causes the problem.
This will be useful later, as a test file, we can use such files directly as
test files.

You can also try to reproduce after resetting CODE preferences —
and tell us if it matters.
This confirms for you that the problem is what you think it is, and is
unrelated to any specific program settings.

## Attach additional info
If your problem is intermittent, try to identify the conditions when does it
appear. When you have hard times reproducing the problem yourself, you can be
sure that it will be even harder for the developers. So please be as specific
as possible when reporting; attach a screenshot, or even a video!

## Ask around
In case you have any problem reporting the bug, please don't hesitate to ask
in the [forum](https://forum.collaboraonline.com/), or
join the {{% chat-room %}} room.
