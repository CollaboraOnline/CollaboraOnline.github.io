## Request materials for conferences or events

If you’re preparing for a conference, meetup, workshop, or any community event and need Collabora-related promotional materials — such as slides, stickers, brochures, or any other swag — you can request them directly from our marketing team.

Send an email to **marketing@collaboraoffice.com** with the details of your event and the items you would like to request.

We recommend including:
- Event name  
- Date and location  
- Estimated number of attendees  
- Materials you need  
- Your postal address (if physical items are required)
